## Web Services Testing
Web Services is the mechanism or the medium of communication through which two applications / machines will exchange the data irrespective of their underline architecture and the technology. It is a type of software testing that validates Webservices.
The purpose of Web Services Testing is to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of an API(Application Program Interface).
Web Service Testing is similar to unit testing in some cases. You can test a Webservice manually or create your own automation code or use an off-the shelf automation tool like Postman.
