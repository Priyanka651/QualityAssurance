## Software Testing
Software testing involves evaluating and verifying a
software product's functionality.
• Basically, it checks whether the software product
matches anticipated requirements and makes sure it is
defect-free.
• It can be said that testing enhances the quality of the
product by preventing bugs, reducing development
costs, and reducing performance issues.

## What are the benefits of Software Testing?
• Cost-Effective: It is one of the important advantages
of software testing. Testing any IT project on time
helps you to save your money for the long term. In
case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software
testing, it costs less to fix.
• Security: It is the most vulnerable and sensitive
benefit of software testing. People are looking for
trusted products. It helps in removing risks and
problems earlier.
• Product quality: It is an essential requirement of any
software product. Testing ensures a quality product is
delivered to customers.

Functional Vs Non-Functional Testing
## Functional Testing             
Functional testing is performed using thefunctional specification provided by the client and verifies the system against the functional requirements.

## Non-Functional Testing
Non-Functional testing checks the Performance, reliability, scalability and other non-functional aspects of the software system.

## Functional testing typically involves six steps
1. The identification of functions that the software is
expected to perform
2. The creation of input data based on the function's
specifications
3. The determination of output based on the function's
specifications
4. The execution of the test case
5. The comparison of actual and expected outputs
6. To check whether the application works as per the
customer need.
