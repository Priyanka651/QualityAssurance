## What is Test Management

Test management is the process of organizing, planning, executing, and monitoring software testing activities to ensure that a product meets quality standards. It involves:

Defining test objectives and strategies.
Documenting test cases and scenarios.
Assigning tasks to team members.
Tracking and reporting testing progress and outcomes.
Managing resources, timelines, and tools for efficient testing.
Effective test management ensures that testing is thorough, organized, and aligned with project goals, helping identify and resolve issues early in the development process.


## What is Test Planning

Test planning is the process of defining the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities for a project. It includes:

Identifying the objectives and scope of testing.
Determining the testing methods (e.g., manual, automated).
Allocating resources such as personnel, tools, and environments.
Establishing timelines and milestones for testing phases.
Documenting the test plan, which serves as a roadmap for testing activities.


## How to write a test plan
1. Test Scope – what to test, what not to test (Out of Scope)
2. Test Objectives – why test
3. Assumptions - what we know or don’t know about UAT
4. Risk Analysis – what happen if we don’t test
5. Test Design – scenarios and test cases
6. Roles & Responsibilities – who is to do what
7. Test Schedule & Resources – time, milestone (check point)
8. Test Data Management – what resources and infrastructures
9. Test Environment – machines, databases
10. Communication Approach – sharing info or doc center
11. Test Tools – test management tool or function testing tool
12. Exit Criteria – when to stop testing
