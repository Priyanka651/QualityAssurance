## Automation Testing

Automation Testing is a software testing technique that uses specialized tools and scripts to execute tests automatically, without human intervention. The goal is to ensure that software functions correctly, efficiently, and meets quality standards.

**Key points about Automation Testing:**

Reduces manual effort: Automates repetitive tasks, saving time and cost.
Improves accuracy: Eliminates human errors during testing.
Increases test coverage: Tests more scenarios, including edge cases, that may be missed in manual testing.
Tools Used: Tools like Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Appium, and others are widely used for automation testing.
Types of Tests Automated: Regression testing, functional testing, performance testing, and unit testing.


## Introduction to Selenium

Selenium is an open-source automation testing framework primarily used for testing web applications. It allows testers to automate browser-based testing across different platforms and browsers.

**Features of Selenium:**
1.Open Source: Free to use and supported by a strong community.

2.Cross-browser Compatibility: Supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and other browsers.

3.Cross-platform Support: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

4.Multi-Language Support: Can be used with programming languages like Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, and Ruby.

5.Integration: Integrates easily with tools like TestNG, JUnit, Maven, Jenkins, and CI/CD pipelines.

Selenium Software is not just a single tool but a suite of software, each piece catering to different Selenium QA testing needs of an organization. Here is the list of tools
## Components of Selenium:
Selenium IDE: A browser extension for recording and playback of tests.
Selenium WebDriver: A powerful API that interacts with browsers to automate user actions.
Selenium Grid: Allows parallel execution of tests across multiple machines and browsers.




## Advantages using Selenium
1. Selenium automation tool is absolutely Free
2. Selenium allows developing and executing test cases
in various programming languages including .NET,
Java, Ruby, Python, PHP and even HTML.
3. Selenium allows simple and powerful DOM-level
testing and in the same time could be used for
testing in the traditional waterfall or Agile
environments.
4. Support Junit and TestNg frameworks.

## Disadvantages using Selenium
1. Programming knowledge required
2. Dreary errors diagnosis
3. Tests only web applications
4. Browser dependent
